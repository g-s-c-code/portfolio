# GC

Hello! I'm GC from Stockholm, currently diving into the world of Fullstack Development. I have a keen interest in technology, design, and science, and I enjoy the challenges and creativity that coding offers. When I take a break from the screen, I often find solace in a quiet walk in the woods or some BMX riding.
